        <h2>Graphic Designer, Travel Photographer & Traditional Artist </h2>

        <p>My name is Nessa Reyna, and I’ve been a graphic design student at Wake Technical Community College in North Carolina for a over a year now. Since I’m only an online student, I’ve decided to take my education on the road. I’ve fully converted a Ford Econoline Passenger Van to house my boyfriend and I, plus our pet family.
          
          Being an artist and student on the road can be a little tricky sometimes but I wouldn’t change it for the world. The freedom of being able to create and capture new places is endless. </p>
